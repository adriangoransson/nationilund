# Nation i Lund

Source code for the site [nationilund.se](https://nationilund.se).

Built with the [Gin Framework](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/), [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Go 1.8 is required for dependency [adriangoransson/studentlund](https://github.com/adriangoransson/studentlund) to run.

Yarn is required to run the makefile, but npm should work just fine.
